      "Based on the initial introductions and matching rating of 10/50, the male student from Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Hellen may not align perfectly in terms of romantic compatibility. However, since both individuals prioritize trust and communication in a relationship, there are foundation stones upon which they could at least establish a platonic acquaintance or supportive friendship.\n",

      "Meeting through a college exchange event, the two begin conversing, drawn together by their shared academic background and similar age. The initial exchanges are polite and respectful; however, their individual preferences soon come to light. The male student shares his hopes of meeting someone who fits his physical ideal, while Hellen elaborates on her own preferences.\n",

Recognizing this common ground, they agree to continue communicating as friends, focusing on the potential of a strong supportive friendship.\n",

They find themselves confiding in each other regarding academic stress and family pressures, benefiting from an empathetic ear.\n",

Hellen and the male student set new boundaries to avoid misunderstandings, establishing a respect for their differing orientations and romantic preferences. This mutual clarity only deepens their connection, free from ambiguities that may tether romantic entanglements.\n",

Their shared interests in academia and mutual support create a meaningful friendship filled with trust, transparency, and invaluable communication.\n",
